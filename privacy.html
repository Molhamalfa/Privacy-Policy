<h2>1. Personal Data We Collect</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We collect information (a) you provide, (b) that is created or collected automatically when you use the Services, and (c) from service providers and platforms you choose to connect.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>A) Personal data that you provide</h3>
<ul>
<li>**General details.** Name or display name, email, age range, fitness goals, and optional attributes such as height/weight you enter during onboarding or later in your profile. Subscription tier and entitlement status are also associated with your account.</li>
<li>**Account photo (optional).** If you choose to upload a profile image.</li>
<li>**Communication information.** If you contact support, we process your email, any attachments, and the content of your messages.</li>
<li>**Nutrition entries.** Free-form meal descriptions and macro targets you input.</li>
<li>**Voice input & transcripts (optional).** If you dictate meals or notes, your audio is transcribed on-device via iOS Speech APIs; with your action, resulting text is processed by our App.</li>
<li>**Body analysis photos (optional).** If you request AI physique analysis, you can upload or capture front/side/back photos for analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>B) Data from Apple frameworks/services you authorize</h3>
<ul>
<li>**HealthKit data (with your consent).** For example, Active Energy (calories burned) and other metrics only if you explicitly grant access. **We do not use HealthKit data for advertising, marketing, or data brokerage.** You can manage permissions in Apple Health > Data Access & Devices.</li>
<li>**iCloud/CloudKit private database.** We store items like your profile, analysis results, and other content you choose to sync in your private CloudKit database tied to your Apple ID.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>C) Data collected automatically</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Device & usage details.** Device model, OS version, app version, language/region, time zone, in-app events (e.g., screens viewed, feature toggles), and basic telemetry to operate and secure the Services.</li>
<li>**Purchase & subscription events.** We receive purchase status, product identifiers, and renewal state via Apple In-App Purchases and **RevenueCat**. We do **not** receive full payment card numbers from Apple.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>D) AI processing inputs & outputs (your choice)</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Gemini requests.** When you use AI features—such as body analysis from photos or meal-text parsing—the App sends necessary inputs (text and, if you opt in, images) to **Google’s Generative AI (Gemini)** via HTTPS. We receive model outputs to display results. See §4 (Sharing) and §5 (Retention) for details.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h2>2. Purposes of Processing</h2>

<p>We process personal data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Provide and maintain the Services.** Core features like onboarding, profile, AI analysis, nutrition logging, rest timers/Live Activities, notifications, and sync.</li>
<li>**Personalize and improve.** Tailor plans and insights; debug, test, and develop new features; conduct product research using **aggregated or de-identified** data.</li>
<li>**Customer support and communications.** Respond to inquiries; send service notices, policy updates, and essential transactional messages.</li>
<li>**Subscriptions & entitlements.** Handle purchase validation, renewals, and access control via Apple IAP and RevenueCat.</li>
<li>**Safety, security, and fraud prevention.** Protect users, detect abuse, enforce policies, and secure the Services.</li>
